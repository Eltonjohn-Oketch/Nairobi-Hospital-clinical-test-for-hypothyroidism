# Nairobi-Hospital-clinical-test-for-hypothyroidism
# Introduction

In this project we will build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroidism. I not use individual decision trees, rather I will use at least 2 out of the 3 advanced models we have studied: Random forests, Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees.

# Project Overview(Description)

Hypothyroidism's deficiency of thyroid hormones can disrupt such things as heart rate, body temperature and all aspects of metabolism. Hypothyroidism is most prevalent in older women.Major symptoms include fatigue, cold sensitivity, constipation, dry skin and unexplained weight gain. Treatment consists of thyroid hormone replacement.
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:  Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.ou should not use individual decision trees, rather you should use at least 2 out of the 3 advanced models we have studied: Random forests, Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees.

# Recording the Experimental Design

Several experimental designs will be used i.e.:

a.Exploratory data analysis

b.Decison trees for classification analysis with several models

# Model Methods
