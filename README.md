# Nairobi-Hospital-clinical-test-for-hypothyroidism
In this project we will build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroidism. I not use individual decision trees, rather I will use at least 2 out of the 3 advanced models we have studied: Random forests, Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees.
